# Live checks still open

Things the code review raised that only a running server can settle. Each is a short, one-off run.

## Anticheat as a player account (final review M4)

`Movement::VerifyMovementFlags` returns early for any account above SEC_PLAYER (Movement.cpp:121-123),
so every live run so far (GM level 3) never exercised the flag-based checks.

1. Grep every `CHEAT_TYPE_*` name in libanticheat.hpp:36-59 against the server log after the run, not a subset
   (the earlier grep left out WALL_CLIMB, TELEPORT, TELEPORT_FAR, BAD_ORDER_ACK and MULTIJUMP).
2. Log a SEC_PLAYER account in. Place the character with `.go xyz` from a GM session (a player cannot teleport itself).
3. Run `walk_to`, `face`, then a walk that stops, and read the server log for anticheat lines (FLY_HACK, WATER_WALK,
   ROOT_MOVE, FIXED_Z, ...). Expect none.

## Warden timeout and addon fingerprint (issue #47)

What to expect is in the README, "What the server sees". Grep the server's anticheat log after a run:

1. `grep -c 'WARDEN: Account .* timeout'`: at most one line per agent session, and only when `Warden.ModuleDir` holds a
   Windows module. Note it as expected; it is not a failure of the run. If the agent is disconnected (exit 6) about
   `Warden.Timeout` seconds after login, the server's `Warden.cpp:498` `KickPlayer()` is live: say so in the report.
2. `grep 'Generated new fingerprint'`: log in twice with the same settings file. Expect the line at the first login
   only (or none, if the account's `addon-fingerprint-*` file already existed), and never at the second. The agent's
   file holds the same value as the line's `0x...`. With `LOG_ANTICHEAT_DEBUG` on, `ADDON: Found fingerprint` marks the
   second login.
3. `ADDON: Found invalid fingerprint` or a new `Generated` line at the second login means the stored value was not
   presented: check the file is next to the settings file in use, and that the same account logged in both times (the file is per account).

Not yet run live: this was added with unit tests against the core's layout only.

## Chat language (final review M5)

`BuildMessageChat` sends every say, party and whisper in LANG_UNIVERSAL. The core accepts it (skill 0,
ChatHandler.cpp:193-203), but a real client speaks its racial language. With one Horde and one Alliance
character in range, check what the other side sees from a non-GM account saying something. Only then decide
whether to send the racial language (and keep Universal for `.` commands).

## Cast result 7 (task 16)

Cast result 7 is mapped to a "wrong faction" text that was never seen live. Trigger it (for example a friendly
spell on an enemy-faction player) and compare the text.

## Falling after `.go xyz` and after a knockback (final review M13, #23)

Since #23 the agent falls and lands on the navmesh floor (README "Falling and knockbacks"). Run on m910q build 17,
2026-10-12 (PR #31):

- `.go xyz` 20 yd above flat ground (GM account): fell 1439 ms, landed at the mesh floor 26.82; the server's `.gps`
  has the same z, GroundZ 26.72. A player account cannot be put in the air: `.summon` snaps z to the ground.
- Knockback (spell 10689 via `.cast self` on the player account): flat, downhill (1473 ms, 6.2 yd lower) and uphill
  (a 45° slope met at once) all acked, flown and landed; the anticheat's movement history shows the ack,
  `0x6000` heartbeats and the landing, every step inside the bound; no "does not match pending" line.

Still open:

1. The m910q anticheat has no `anticheat.conf` (`[Anticheat] Could not find configuration file`), so every
   detector's thresholds are 0 (`AnticheatConfig::IsEnabled` false) and `Movement.SpeedHack.Enable` is off: no
   CHEAT_TYPE can fire there. The steps were replayed offline against `GetMaxAllowedDist` instead. Repeat with the
   template (`src/game/Anticheat/anticheat.conf.readonly`) installed.
2. Fall damage after a knockback over 14.57 yd (`Player::HandleFall`), and feather fall applied mid-flight (expect no
   OVERSPEED_Z under the 7 yd/s bound, Movement.cpp:874-881).

## Game objects over RPC (#73 step 1)

Run on m910q build 17, 2026-10-13 (GM account, `.gm visible on`, own character only; teleports by `teleport`), Uldaman, map 70:

- `gameobjects` at the entrance listed 55 objects within 200 yd, named from the query responses (Dwarven Campfire, Baelog's Chest, Keystone,
  Large Mithril Bound Chest ...). Doors carry flags 32, the Ancient Vault 33 (in use, `usable` false), the Large Mithril Bound Chest 2 (`locked`).
  A mining node 66 yd away came back as `outcome` `none` with the distance hint.
- `use_object` on the Keystone door 2.6 yd away answered at once: `gameobject` events `flags` 32 to 5 and `state` ready to active, and the linked
  Seal of Khaz'Mul door opened with the same two changes. It stayed open for the 45 s watched.
- `use_object` on chests ends in `none`: the Food Crate (1.3 yd away, `dyn_flags` 1), Baelog's Chest and the Iron Deposit (3.1 yd) got no answer.
  The core's `GameObject::Use` for a chest only runs scripts, so the client opens a chest by casting an Opening spell at it. Not covered yet.
- The capture of the run is `testdata/captures/m7-gameobjects.twcap` (trimmed: no creature moves, spell hits, chat), used by the objects, game
  and session tests.

Still open: a lever or button (type 1), a goober or altar (type 10) and a `text` object (Baelog's Journal; the agent does not read `SMSG_GAMEOBJECT_PAGETEXT` yet) were not used; run one of each and record what the server sends.

## Dungeon plan: Uldaman (#73 step 2)

`dungeons/uldaman.json` was written from the world database (m910q, 2026-10-13, SELECTs only) and checked offline: every waypoint
(39 of them, entrance to Ironaya) is a `complete` navmesh route from the one before it (`TestUldamanOnNavmesh`, map 70 tiles from m910q).
Nothing in it has been walked by an agent yet. Still open, for the driver (step 3):

- The navmesh has no doors: `path_to` goes through the Keystone and Seal of Khaz'Mul while they are closed. Walk the Keystone leg live
  and confirm the door steps (use the Keystone from the `stand` point, the Seal reaches `active`) before the Ironaya leg.
- Pack positions are spawn points. Pack members that patrol (`creature_movement`) or wander, and the Stonevault Ambushers (stealth),
  may stand elsewhere when the party arrives.
- The Seal at 55 yd must be in view (listed by `gameobjects`) from the Keystone's stand point for the `wait_for` to see its state change.
